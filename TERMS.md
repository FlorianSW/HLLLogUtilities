# Privacy Policy

No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen. Data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.
Stored data includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Hell Let Loose server RCON credentials (hostname, RCON port, RCON password)

## Stored Information
The bot does not automatically store any information when being invited to a new Discord Server.

## Updating Data
Data may be updated when using specific features of the bot.
Some of these updates may include data that can be seen as sensitive. All such updates require explicit confirmation from the user. This data is only kept in the database and only used for its intended purpose.

## Removal of Data
Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by using the moderation features provided by Discord.
Re-adding the bot back to the server will store data again, as described in the Stored Information section of this policy.

Manual removal of the data can be requested through [an Issue on HLL Log Utilities' Github page](https://github.com/timraay/HLLLogUtilities/issues).
For security reasons you will need to provide us with proof of ownership of the server that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
