# FAQ

> Below is a list of questions that I often see floating around. If you have an issue or question, chances are you can find the answer below. If it does not, or you want to report a bug, then you can open an Issue here on GitHub or reach me on Discord (@Abu#6969).

## I'm getting kicked from servers!
HLU in some scenarios will kick certain players whose name causes incompatibility issues. In such a case, it should state at the top that the action was performed by HLU, and it will also briefly explain what you need to change.

In short, the 20th character in your name can't be a space. A select few special characters also can't be used as 20th character. If you are being kicked, have a look at the message; It should tell you what character you need to change. This may not always be the 20th character. It could also be the 19th or 18th character.

Once you've changed your name and restarted your game, you should be able to join the server again.

## How can I give users permission to use the bot's commands?
By default, all commands require users to have either Administrator or Manage Server permissions. You can change this by going to your Server Settings, then to Integrations, where you should be able to find HLL Log Utilities. From there, you can add permission overwrites to certain roles, users, and/or channels.

## "This interaction failed" / Bot thinking indefinitely
When you press a button or select an item from a dropdown, the bot may think for a few seconds, sometimes indefinitely, until Discord tells you that the interaction failed. When this happens, it normally simply means that the message has expired. Try running the command again. If that doesn't resolve the issue, chances are you've found a bug.

## Receiving an "Unexpected Error"
As the error implies, this error is unexpected. In other words, you are not supposed to get such errors. Best to do in such a case is open an Issue here on GitHub.

## How long will my logs remain available for?
Logs will remain available for 14 days after the session has ended, unless you manually delete them sooner. Self-hosted instances have the option to change this value. Run the `/session list` command to see how long you have left until your existing sessions expire and delete themselves.
